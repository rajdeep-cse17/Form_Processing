# Form Processing

This is an implementation of a generic form processing system as described in the paper "Understanding contents of filled-in Bangla form images" https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11042-020-09751-3?sharing_token=4ooyk1LDThJyc1MldWLkOve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7WSCkLr4ylKzZuZMyaf0QBu-ToHAdVHYhG-8r0J5S6TnfNgi4P3Esv1KGwK18GVSqx-X3zVl1NJJJwXHansWBcID6rMd6kuH2yN5MrCspUWFi1_3f3nJS_gnd-lD0wPWc%3D

The code is tested on an in-house database, some samples of which are provided in the repository.
